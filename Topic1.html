                Imagine you just opened a cool new store, but instead of being downtown, it’s online. You’ve got a website full of great products, services, or maybe even blog posts. But now comes the big question: How do you know if people are visiting, and what they’re doing once they arrive? That’s where web analytics comes in.

                Web analytics is like the behind-the-scenes tool that helps you track everything happening on your website. It collects data about your visitors—where they came from, what pages they looked at, how long they stayed, and whether they did something important like making a purchase or filling out a form.
            </p>
            <h4>Some of the basic terms you’ll hear include:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Page Views – How many times a page on your site was seen</li>
                <li>Sessions – A visitor’s full trip through your site from arrival to exit</li>
                <li>Bounce Rate – The percentage of people who came to your site and left without clicking anything else</li>
                <li>Conversion Rate – The number of people who completed a goal (like signing up or buying something)</li>
                <li>Traffic Sources – Where your visitors are coming from (Google, social media, or directly typing in your web address)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Web analytics helps you answer questions like: Are people finding my site through search engines? Which pages do they like the most? Why are some visitors leaving so quickly? Think of it as a fitness tracker for your website. It tells you what’s working, what’s not, and where you can improve.
