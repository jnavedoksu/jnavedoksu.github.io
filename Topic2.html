      <h2>Importance of Web Analytics</h2>
      <p><strong>Brief Summary:</strong> Web analytics gives you real data about your website’s performance. It helps you understand what’s working, what needs improvement, and how to grow your online presence effectively.</p>

      <h3>Key Terms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>User Behavior</li>
        <li>Call to Action (CTA)</li>
        <li>Audience Insights</li>

      <p>
        Whether you're running a business site, personal blog, or school project, it's important to know how users are interacting with your content. Web analytics gives you that visibility. It's not just numbers and charts—it's real insight into your audience’s behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analytics takes the guesswork out of website management. It helps you understand which content is attracting visitors, which pages cause confusion, what devices people are using, and how they found your site in the first place.

      <h4>Why It Matters</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Understand Your Audience</strong>
          <p>
            Learn what devices people are using, where they’re from, what time they’re most active, and what pages they enjoy most. This allows you to better tailor your site to your visitors' needs and habits.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Improve Website Performance</strong>
          <p>
            If users are leaving quickly or not clicking anything, web analytics can help you spot where the experience breaks down. You can test changes like new layouts or headlines to see what keeps visitors engaged.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Make Smart Marketing Decisions</strong>
          <p>
            Analytics can show if your ads, emails, or social media efforts are working. You'll know how many people clicked, what they did afterward, and if they completed a goal like making a purchase or signing up.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        In short, web analytics lets you make smart, data-driven decisions that lead to better user experiences and real results.
