        There are many tools available to help you collect and understand web analytics data. Whether you're managing a personal blog, a business website, or a class project, the right tool can give you valuable insights into how users interact with your content.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Google Analytics</strong> is the most popular tool. It’s free and powerful, offering detailed reports on traffic sources, user behavior, device types, and much more. It gives you a big-picture view while also allowing you to explore specific user paths.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Hotjar</strong> adds a visual element with heatmaps and session recordings. These tools show where users click, scroll, and spend time. This makes it easier to improve your layout and content based on what actually catches user attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Matomo</strong> is a privacy-focused alternative. It's open-source and gives you full control over your analytics data—ideal for organizations with strict privacy requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Adobe Analytics</strong> is designed for large businesses and teams that need deep, customizable insights. It’s powerful but more complex and better suited for advanced marketing and data teams.

It allows businesses, students, and content creators to optimize content, fix issues, and improve user satisfaction.
